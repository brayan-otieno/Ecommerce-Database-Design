# 🛒 E-commerce Database Project

## 📌 Overview
- This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive relational database for an e-commerce platform.
- Built by a peer group to learn and practice professional database design principles.

## 📁 Project Contents
- ✅ **ERD Diagram** – Entity Relationship Diagram representing all tables and their relationships.
- ✅ **SQL Script** – Complete schema with table creation and constraints (`ecommerce.sql`).
- ✅ **Data Flow Documentation** – Outlines how data flows between tables (`ecommerce_data_flow_documentation.txt`).

## 🧱 Core Tables
- `product`
- `brand`
- `product_category`
- `product_image`
- `product_variation`
- `product_item`
- `color`
- `size_category`
- `size_option`
- `product_attribute`
- `attribute_category`
- `attribute_type`

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the SQL script into your MySQL database.
3. Explore the ERD and data flow documentation for understanding.

## 📂 Repository Structure
-ecommerce.sql.
-e-commerce_database_ERD.drawio.pdf.
-e-commerce_table_definitions.pdf.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- Tested in MySQL Workbench.
- Tables created without errors and constraints validated successfully.
- ERD used to cross-check relationships and key mappings.

## 📊 Key Features
- Normalized schema to avoid data redundancy.
- Clear use of primary and foreign keys.
- Scalable structure for future e-commerce features like inventory, cart, orders, and users.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) – for DB design and SQL execution
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) – for drawing the ERD
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) – for version control and collaboration

## ✅ Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience in relational database design.
- Improved understanding of data flow and table normalization.
- Team collaboration using GitHub for academic software projects.
